## Critical Implementation Details

### Authentication Flow
```ruby
# TastyTrade uses session-based auth, NOT OAuth!
auth_service = Tastytrade::AuthService.new
auth_service.authenticate(
  username: "your-email@example.com",  # NOT a client ID
  password: "your-password"            # Your actual TastyTrade password
)
```

### Environment Setup
```bash
# Sandbox (fake money testing)
TASTYTRADE_USERNAME=sandbox-email@example.com
TASTYTRADE_PASSWORD=sandbox-password
TASTYTRADE_API_URL=https://api.cert.tastyworks.com

# Production (real money)
TASTYTRADE_USERNAME=your-real-email@example.com
TASTYTRADE_PASSWORD=your-real-password
TASTYTRADE_API_URL=https://api.tastyworks.com
```

## How to Resume Development

### 1. Environment Setup
```bash
cd /home/rorystouder/projects/tastytradesUI

# Install dependencies if needed
bundle install

# Run migrations if needed
rails db:migrate

# Start server
rails server
```

### 2. Test Current Setup
```bash
# Test TastyTrade authentication
./bin/test_tastytrade_auth

# Run sandbox tests
./bin/sandbox_test

# Check system status
rails console
User.first.tastytrade_authenticated?
```

### 3. Key Commands
```bash
# Switch between environments
./bin/switch_environment

# Run scanner manually
rails console
MarketScannerJob.perform_now(User.first.id)

# Access web interfaces
http://localhost:3000/dashboard  # Main dashboard
http://localhost:3000/scanner    # Scanner interface
http://localhost:3000/sandbox    # Testing interface
```

## Important Reminders

### üõ°Ô∏è 25% Cash Reserve Protection
- **NEVER DISABLED** - Core safety feature
- Enforced at database level
- Checked before every trade
- User cannot override

### üîê Authentication
- **NO API KEYS** - TastyTrade uses username/password
- Sandbox needs separate account from developer.tastytrade.com
- Tokens expire after 24 hours
- Automatic re-auth prompts in UI

### üìä Trading Rules
- Maximum 5 trades per scan
- POP must be ‚â• 65%
- Risk/reward must be ‚â• 0.33
- Max 2 trades per sector
- Scanner runs every 5 minutes during market hours

### üß™ Testing
- Always test in sandbox first
- Sandbox orders fill at specific prices (market=$1, limit‚â§$3=fill)
- Use separate database for sandbox
- Monitor all test results

## Next Development Steps

1. **If WebSocket needed**: Implement real-time data streaming
2. **Enhanced Features**: 
   - Email/SMS trade notifications
   - Performance analytics dashboard
   - Multiple account support
   - More option strategies

3. **Production Deployment**:
   - Set up production server
   - Configure production database
   - Set up monitoring/logging
   - Deploy with proper security

## Git Status
- Repository initialized and working
- Main branch is stable
- All code committed except Ruby installation files
- Ready for continued development

**Primary Developer Note**: System is fully functional for automated option trading with safety measures in place. The 25% cash reserve protection is the most critical feature and must never be removed or bypassed.
