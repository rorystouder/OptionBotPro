## Critical Implementation Details

### Authentication Flow
```ruby
# TastyTrade uses session-based auth, NOT OAuth!
auth_service = Tastytrade::AuthService.new
auth_service.authenticate(
  username: "your-email@example.com",  # NOT a client ID
  password: "your-password"            # Your actual TastyTrade password
)
```

### Environment Setup
```bash
# Sandbox (fake money testing)
TASTYTRADE_USERNAME=sandbox-email@example.com
TASTYTRADE_PASSWORD=sandbox-password
TASTYTRADE_API_URL=https://api.cert.tastyworks.com

# Production (real money)
TASTYTRADE_USERNAME=your-real-email@example.com
TASTYTRADE_PASSWORD=your-real-password
TASTYTRADE_API_URL=https://api.tastyworks.com
```
