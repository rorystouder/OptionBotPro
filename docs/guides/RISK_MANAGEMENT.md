# Risk Management System

The OptionBotPro includes comprehensive risk management and portfolio protection features to safeguard your capital during automated trading.

## üõ°Ô∏è Core Protection Features

### 1. Cash Reserve Protection
- **Default**: 25% of buying power must remain in cash
- **Purpose**: Ensures you never commit all available funds
- **Override**: Can be adjusted between 20-50%, but 25% is recommended
- **Enforcement**: All trades are blocked if they would violate this reserve

### 2. Daily Loss Limits
- **Default**: 5% maximum daily loss
- **Purpose**: Prevents catastrophic losses during bad market days
- **Action**: Automatic emergency stop when limit is reached
- **Recovery**: Manual intervention required to resume trading

### 3. Single Trade Size Limits
- **Default**: 10% maximum of portfolio per trade
- **Purpose**: Prevents over-concentration in single positions
- **Calculation**: Based on total portfolio value, not just cash
- **Flexibility**: Adjustable between 5-20% based on risk tolerance

### 4. Portfolio Exposure Limits
- **Default**: Maximum 75% of portfolio can be in active positions
- **Purpose**: Maintains liquidity and reduces overall portfolio risk
- **Calculation**: Total market value of all positions vs. portfolio value
- **Complement**: Works with 25% cash reserve requirement

## üö® Emergency Stop System

### Automatic Triggers
1. **Daily Loss Exceeded**: Stops all trading when daily loss limit is hit
2. **API Errors**: Temporary halt during connection issues
3. **Validation Failures**: Stops trading if risk checks fail repeatedly
4. **Account Restrictions**: Triggered by PDT or margin violations

### Manual Emergency Stop
- Available via API endpoint or web interface
- Immediately cancels all pending orders
- Blocks all new order submissions
- Requires manual confirmation to clear

### Recovery Process
1. **Identify Cause**: Review emergency stop reason
2. **Address Issues**: Fix underlying problems (account funding, etc.)
3. **Manual Clearance**: Explicitly clear emergency stop with confirmation
4. **Gradual Resume**: Consider starting with smaller position sizes

## üìä Risk Validation Process

### Pre-Trade Validation
Every order goes through these checks:

1. **Emergency Stop Check**: Is trading currently halted?
2. **Cash Reserve Check**: Will this trade violate reserve requirements?
3. **Trade Size Check**: Is this trade within single-trade limits?
4. **Daily Loss Check**: Has daily loss limit been reached?
5. **Exposure Check**: Will this exceed maximum portfolio exposure?
6. **Concentration Check**: Will this over-concentrate in one symbol?

### Order Blocking
- Orders that fail ANY risk check are automatically rejected
- Detailed violation reasons are logged and returned
- No partial fills - orders are either fully approved or fully rejected

### Alert Settings
- **Email Alerts**: Notifications for risk violations
- **SMS Alerts**: Emergency notifications (requires phone number)
- **Log Alerts**: All decisions logged for audit trail

## üèóÔ∏è Implementation Details

### Database Storage
- `portfolio_protections` table stores per-account settings
- Unique constraint ensures one protection per user/account
- Database constraints enforce safe value ranges
- Audit trail tracks all emergency stop events

### Caching Strategy
- Emergency stops cached in Redis for fast access
- Portfolio status cached for performance
- Cache keys include user and account identifiers
- Automatic cache expiration prevents stale data

### API Integration
- Real-time account data from TastyTrade API
- Position valuation uses current market prices
- Buying power checks include maintenance requirements
- Order validation before API submission

## üîç Monitoring and Logging

### Risk Decision Logging
Every trade decision is logged with:
- Order parameters and validation result
- Account snapshot at decision time
- Specific violations (if any)
- Timestamp and user identification

### Performance Tracking
- Daily P&L monitoring
- Exposure percentage tracking
- Trade count and frequency analysis
- Risk limit utilization metrics

### Alert Thresholds
- **Warning (80% of limit)**: Yellow alert, increased monitoring
- **Critical (95% of limit)**: Red alert, consider position reduction
- **Violation (100% of limit)**: Automatic trading halt
