# IMMEDIATE DEPLOYMENT SOLUTION

Railway is having Docker Hub issues. Here are two working alternatives:

## Option 1: Deploy to Render.com (RECOMMENDED - Works Now!)

### Step 1: Sign up at render.com (free)
https://render.com

### Step 2: Create New Web Service
1. Click "New +" â†’ "Web Service"
2. Connect your GitHub account
3. Select your `tastytradesUI` repository
4. Fill in:
   - **Name**: optionbotpro
   - **Region**: Oregon (US West)
   - **Branch**: main
   - **Runtime**: Ruby
   - **Build Command**: `bundle install && bundle exec rails assets:precompile`
   - **Start Command**: `bundle exec rails db:migrate && bundle exec rails server -b 0.0.0.0 -p $PORT`

### Step 3: Choose Free Plan to Start
- Select "Free" plan (upgradeable later)
- Free includes 750 hours/month

### Step 4: Add Environment Variables
Click "Advanced" and add:
```
RAILS_MASTER_KEY=<copy from config/master.key>
RAILS_ENV=production
RAILS_SERVE_STATIC_FILES=true
RAILS_LOG_TO_STDOUT=true
SECRET_KEY_BASE=<generate with: rails secret>
DATABASE_URL=sqlite3:///opt/render/project/src/db/production.sqlite3
```

### Step 5: Deploy
Click "Create Web Service" - it will auto-deploy!

## Option 2: Deploy to Fly.io (Also Reliable)

### Step 1: Install Fly CLI
```bash
# On Windows WSL/Linux:
curl -L https://fly.io/install.sh | sh
export PATH="$HOME/.fly/bin:$PATH"
```

### Step 2: Sign Up & Deploy
```bash
# Sign up (free)
fly auth signup

# Or login if you have account
fly auth login

# Launch app (from your project directory)
cd /home/rorystouder/projects/tastytradesUI
fly launch

# When prompted:
# - App name: optionbotpro
# - Region: iad (Virginia - closest to markets)
# - PostgreSQL: No
# - Redis: No
# - Deploy now: Yes
```

### Step 3: Set Secrets
```bash
# Get your master key
cat config/master.key

# Set it in Fly
fly secrets set RAILS_MASTER_KEY=<your-master-key-here>

# Deploy
fly deploy
```

### Step 4: Open Your App
```bash
fly open
```

---

## Option 3: Try Railway CLI (If You Still Want Railway)

```bash
# Install Railway CLI
npm install -g @railway/cli

# Or on Linux/WSL:
curl -fsSL https://railway.app/install.sh | sh

# Login
railway login

# Create new project
railway init

# Link and deploy
railway link
railway up

# If it fails, try:
railway up --detach
```

---

## Why These Work:

1. **Render.com**: Uses Heroku buildpacks, no Docker needed
2. **Fly.io**: Has their own build system, very Rails-friendly
3. **Railway CLI**: Sometimes works when web UI fails

## Emergency Quick Deploy:

If you need it running RIGHT NOW, use **Render.com**:
- Takes 10 minutes total
- Free tier available
- No Docker issues
- Auto-SSL included

## Your App URLs Will Be:
- Render: `https://optionbotpro.onrender.com`
- Fly.io: `https://optionbotpro.fly.dev`
- Railway: `https://optionbotpro.up.railway.app`

Pick Render.com - it's working perfectly right now and doesn't have the Docker issues Railway is experiencing!
