              <h3 class="text-danger mb-3">1. OPTIONS TRADING RISKS</h3>
              <div class="mb-4">
                <p><strong>High Risk of Loss:</strong> Options trading carries a high level of risk and may not be suitable for all investors. The risk of loss in trading options can be substantial.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Total Loss Possible:</strong> You may lose your entire investment in a short period of time. Options may expire worthless, resulting in 100% loss of premium paid.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Leveraged Positions:</strong> Options provide leverage, which can magnify both profits and losses. Small movements in the underlying security can result in large percentage gains or losses.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Time Decay:</strong> Options lose value as they approach expiration (time decay/theta), even if the underlying security doesn't move against you.</p>
              </div>

              <h3 class="text-danger mb-3">2. AUTOMATED TRADING RISKS</h3>
              <div class="mb-4">
                <p><strong>System Failures:</strong> Automated trading systems can experience technical failures, including software bugs, connectivity issues, or hardware malfunctions that may result in unexpected losses.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Market Volatility:</strong> Rapid market movements can cause automated systems to execute trades at unfavorable prices or fail to execute protective stops.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Algorithm Limitations:</strong> No trading algorithm can guarantee profits. Past performance does not indicate future results.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Human Oversight Required:</strong> Automated systems require regular monitoring and may need manual intervention during unusual market conditions.</p>
              </div>

              <h3 class="text-danger mb-3">3. MARKET RISKS</h3>
              <div class="mb-4">
                <p><strong>Volatility Risk:</strong> Sudden changes in market volatility can significantly impact option prices and trading strategies.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Liquidity Risk:</strong> Some options may have limited liquidity, making it difficult to execute trades at desired prices.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Gap Risk:</strong> Markets can gap up or down, causing significant losses that exceed planned risk parameters.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Assignment Risk:</strong> Short option positions may be assigned at any time, potentially resulting in substantial losses.</p>
              </div>

              <h3 class="text-danger mb-3">4. SPECIFIC STRATEGY RISKS</h3>
              <div class="mb-4">
                <p><strong>Credit Spreads:</strong> Maximum loss can be significant if the underlying moves against the position. Early assignment risk exists.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Iron Condors:</strong> Vulnerable to significant moves in either direction. Management becomes difficult in trending markets.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Naked Options:</strong> If applicable, naked option positions carry unlimited risk potential.</p>
              </div>
